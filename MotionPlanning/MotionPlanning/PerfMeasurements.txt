A*, PRM w/ no accel:
100 nodes: 
	PRM Con: ~16-17ms
	Solution: ~1ms
1000 nodes:
	PRM Con: ~1300ms
	Solution: ~15-30ms
	
A*, PRM using KDTree & linking to 5 nearest neighbors:
100 nodes:
	PRM Con: ~40-50ms
		Of this, KDTree construction is ~8-11ms
	Solution: ~1ms
1000 nodes:
	PRM Con: ~500ms
		Of this, KDTree construction is ~160ms
	Solution: ~5-7ms
	
Cup scenario, -10 to 10, solution time, 500 nodes:
	With A*: 4-4.5ms
	Greedy: 1-1.3ms
